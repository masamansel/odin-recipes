      This is a great recipe that I found in my Grandma's recipe book. Judging
      from the weathered look of this recipe card, this was a family favorite.

        <li>
          Then add the flour and baking powder then whisk it until a real good
          batter appears (i dont know how tf to explain it make it and see it
          for yourself)
          <p><b>Tip:</b>If batter is too thick add more milk if its too runny add more flour</p>
        </li>
      </p>
      <p><li>Heat a frying pan on medium and wipe it with tissue and oil then take 1/4 cup of the batter then pour it on the pan then bubbles will start to appear when the bubbles stop appearing flip the pancake then wait 2-4 minutes until the other side is done then use up the rest of the batter (duh) then cook and serve the pancakes with honey or whatever you guys use for pancakes</li></p>
