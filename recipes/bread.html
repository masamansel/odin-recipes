    <center><h2>Homemade Pita Bread</h2></center>
    <p>
      This homemade pita bread recipe is easy to make and requires a few
      ingredients you may already have on hand! Mix up the very simple dough,
      let it rise, and experience the magic of fresh, warm, perfectly puffy
      homemade pita bread. Baking and skillet instructions included!
    </p>
    <p>
      As someone who grew up on authentic fresh pita bread from Egyptian
      bakeries, I can tell you this: pita bread we buy at grocery stores here in
      the U.S. is simply not the same. Like store-bought sandwich bread,
      store-bought pita has typically been sitting on the shelf for a few days.
    </p>
    <p>
      Don't get me wrong, I have bought pita at the store many times. It must be
      warmed up and used pretty quickly.
    </p>
    <p>
      But what I'm after here is: Fresh. Warm. Fragrant. Perfectly puffy pita
      bread. Making it takes me back to the streets of Egypt where I grew up.
    </p>
    <p>
      This recipe will make 8 pitas. And you can bake them in the oven or cook
      them stovetop in a hot skillet.

    <center><h1>Ingredients</h1></center>
    <ul>
      <p><li>Water</li></p>
      <p><li>Yeast</li></p>
      <p><li>Pinch of Sugar</li></p>
      <p>
        <li>
          All-purpose flour (or a combination of all-purpose flour and whole
          wheat flour)
        </li>
      </p>
      <p><li>Salt</li></p>
      <p><li>Extra virgin olive oil</li></p>
    </ul>
    <center><h1>Steps</h1></center>
    <ol>
      <p>
        <li>
          Combine 1 cup lukewarm water in a large mixing bowl with yeast and
          sugar. Stir until dissolved. Add ½ cup flour and whisk together. Place
          the mixing bowl in a warm (not hot) place, uncovered. Wait about 15
          minutes or until mixture is frothy and bubbling a bit
          <p>
            <b>Tip:</b> If you don't see some bubbles, your yeast is dead. Start
            over with new yeast.
          </p>
        </li>
      </p>
      <p>
        <li>
          Now add salt, olive oil, and the remaining flour (keep about ½ cup of
          the flour for dusting later). Stir until mixture forms a shaggy mass.
          (What's a shaggy mass? Basically, at this point, the dough has little
          to no gluten development and just looks like a sticky mess and you can
          easily pull bits off). Dust with a little flour, then knead the
          mixture inside the bowl for about 1 minute incorporating any stray
          bits.
        </li>
      </p>
      <p>
        <li>
          Dust a clean working surface with just a little bit of flour. Knead
          lightly for 2 minutes or so until smooth. Cover and let the dough rest
          for 10 minutes, then knead again for a couple more minutes. The dough
          should be soft and a little bit moist, you can help it with a little
          dusting flour, but try not to add too much.
        </li>
      </p>
      <p>
        <li>
          Clean the mixing bowl and give it a light coating of extra virgin
          olive oil. Put the dough back in the bowl and turn it a couple times
          just to coat it a bit with the olive oil.
          <p>
            Cover the mixing bowl tightly with plastic wrap, then cover it with
            a kitchen towel. Put the bowl in a warm (not hot) place. Leave it
            for 1 hour or until the dough rises to double its size.
          </p>
        </li>
      </p>
      <p>
        <li>
          Gently deflate the dough and place it on a clean work surface. Divide
          the dough into 7 to 8 equal pieces and shape them into balls. Cover
          with a towel and leave them for 10 minutes or so.
        </li>
      </p>
      <p>
        <li>
          Using a floured rolling pin, roll one of the pieces into a circle
          that's 8-9 inches wide and about a quarter inch thick. It helps to
          lift and turn the dough frequently as you roll so that dough doesn't
          stick to your counter too much. (If dough starts to stick, sprinkle a
          tiny bit of flour). If the dough starts to spring back, set it aside
          to rest for a few minutes, then continue rolling. Repeat with the
          other pieces of dough.
          <p>
            <b>Tip:</b> Once you get going, you can be cooking one pita while
            rolling another, if you like.
          </p>
        </li>
      </p>
      <p><li> Heat the oven to 475 degrees F and place a heavy-duty baking pan or large cast iron skillet on the middle rack to heat. Working in batches, place the rolled-out pitas directly on the hot baking baking sheet (I was only able to fit 2 at a time).

        Bake for 2 minutes on one side, and then, using a pair of tongs, carefully turn pita over to bake for 1 minute on the other side.  The pita will puff nicely and should be ready. Remove from the oven and cover the baked pitas with a clean towel while you work on the rest of the pitas.</li></p>
