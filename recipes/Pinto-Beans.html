     <center> <h1>Perfect Pinto Beans</h1></center>
      <p>
        Recently I’ve been thinking a lot about revisiting some of the foods
        from my childhood. One recent trip down memory lane led me to a big ole
        pot of pinto beans. (One of my favorite ways to eat them is spooned over
        a slice of cornbread and topped with some pickled relish. Yum!) I love
        them when they’re cooked until nice and tender, with an almost creamy
        consistency.
      </p>
      <p>
        Something that baffles me every time I think about it is that this isn’t
        a recipe that I’ve incorporated into my regular repertoire of
        dishes—though it certainly deserves a spot. Yes, of course, I eat beans
        as a regular part of my diet, but for the vast majority of my adult life
        they’ve come from a can because I often forget to plan ahead for cooking
        dry beans. Now don’t get me wrong, I love canned beans and use them a
        lot, but there’s something about a long-simmered pot of pinto beans that
        warms my soul.

        When cooking with dry beans, the first thing you always want to do is to
        pick through them. What you’re looking for are any beans that are
        shriveled, super dark, or otherwise appear off. You should also be on
        the lookout for any small rocks or other inedible debris that might have
        found its way into the bag.

</p>

    <p>    <li>
          Drain and rinse the beans, then put them in a large pot. Cover the
