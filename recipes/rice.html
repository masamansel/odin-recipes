   <center> <h1>How To Cook Rice (Perfectly)</h1></center>
    <p>
      A humble pot of rice can easily turn any meal into a scrumptious feast.
      It’s the perfect blank slate – so use it as a side dish or the base of a
      healthy dinner. And yes, you can even meal prep it (we’ll get to that
      part).
    </p>
    <p>
      Rice has over 15 vitamins and minerals including B-vitamins that help with
      metabolism, as as well as iron and zinc to help keep our bodies running as
      they should. The brand I personally use and love, Lundberg Farms, has been
      growing healthy, great-tasting rice since 1937 while respecting and
      sustaining the earth for future generations. I also love that they’re a
      leader in organic farming.

    <center><h1>Steps</h1></center>
    <ol>
      <li>
       <p> <h3>Rinse the rice.</h3> Make sure to always rinse your rice before you begin
        cooking. This will wash away dusty starches that could result in your
        rice sticking together in clumps. All you need to do is rinse your rice
        in a fine mesh sieve until the water runs clear.</p>
      </li>
      <li>
       <p> <h3>Combine in a pot</h3>. In a pot add 1 cup of rice plus 1 1/2 cups of water,
        then bring to a boil. Once it’s boiling, cover with a lid</p>
      </li>
      <li>
       <p> <h3>Let it simmer.</h3> Once you add the lid, turn the heat to low and let it
        simmer for about 15 minutes. Check to see when all the water has been
        absorbed and the rice is tender.</p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p> <h3>Steam and fluff.</h3> Turn off the heat and let the rice simmer, covered, for
        about 5 minutes. Then uncover, fluff it up and serve.</p>
